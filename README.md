# 4ORMan

**Build • Verify • Share**

A local AI-assisted development control plane built around deterministic execution — with a hard switch between **Manual mode** (you drive, you decide) and **Auto mode** (it drives, it decides — honored until you close the terminal).

---

## What is it?

4ORMan is a framework that runs on top of Claude Code. It adds structure to every session: a spec interview before any work begins, a verification step before any output ships, and a native CLI (`4orman-tools`) that replaces Claude's inline shell reasoning with structured JSON subcommands — so every session starts fast, stays on track, and spends tokens on reasoning instead of parsing. Every launch asks once, up front: manual or auto — and holds that answer for the life of the terminal session.

---

## Who is it for?

Engineers, technical teams, and agencies running real projects with Claude Code. Claude is a skilled worker — but without structure it builds the wrong thing confidently, skips verification, and forgets what was decided last session. 4ORMan puts a 4orman on the job: specs before work, verification before shipping, and a knowledgebase that carries context across every session.

---

## Why does it exist?

AI-assisted development without determinism is expensive guesswork. Every token Claude spends parsing git output or re-deriving project state is waste. 4ORMan eliminates that waste: a session that starts slower or burns more tokens than without it is a failure.

---

## Features

- **Spec-first workflow** — `/new-project` interviews you, writes a scope, requires sign-off before any code is written
- **Built-in verification** — `/verify-output` runs a self-review then an independent Claude critic agent before anything ships
- **Native CLI** — `4orman-tools` replaces shell parsing with 70 structured JSON subcommands
- **TUI dashboard** — interactive split-panel project overview
- **Worker system** — language workers (Python, Node, Go, Swift, Zig, and more) for tasks that need a runtime
- **Plugin ecosystem** — public and private plugins via `/setup`, share as a zip
- **Portable knowledge** — pinned knowledge backs up to your private GitHub, restores on any machine in three commands
- **Token discipline** — every framework line earns its place; no commentary, no placeholders, no duplication

---

## Philosophy

- AI assists. It does not replace engineering judgment.
- Local execution first. Nothing phones home.
- Deterministic tooling — Zig, not shell scripts.
- Human remains in control. Every release requires a diff review.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap michaelvgonzaga/4orman
brew trust michaelvgonzaga/4orman
brew install orman-ai
```

Then from any directory:

```bash
4orman-ai
```

On first run it walks you through setup and opens your 4ORMan workspace in Claude Code.

**Update:**
```bash
brew upgrade orman-ai
```

**Uninstall:**
```bash
brew uninstall orman-ai && brew untap michaelvgonzaga/4orman
```

**Manual install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelvgonzaga/4orman.git
claude /path/to/4orman
```

## Quick Start

Inside Claude Code:

1. Run `/first-run` — one-time setup: dependency checks, GitHub auth, mode selection (Power User or Guest), pinned knowledge restore. Takes ~2 minutes.
2. Run `/new-project` — spec interview → scoped build → verify → ship.

```

**Session startup is under 200ms.** All git state, tool versions, and project context come from `4orman-tools` as pre-computed JSON — no Claude tokens spent parsing shell output.

## Token savings

Every cache hit, git query, and build-result read that goes through `4orman-tools` instead of Claude's inline reasoning saves tokens. Check your running total anytime:

```bash
4orman-tools metrics
```

```json
{
  "cacheEntries": 10,
  "estimatedTokenSavings": 1600,
  "note": "savings estimated at 80% hit rate x 200 tokens/hit"
}
```

Savings compound as the cache warms across sessions and more subcommands cover more of your workflow.
